'''This lab is meant to challenge you with a more realistic engineering
application of generators: producing record data from a text file of
unbounded length, where each record spans multiple lines.

WARC, or Web ARChive, is an archival format for web pages.
There's an example in this folder in 'crawl-data.warc'.

For this lab, you mainly need to know that a WARC file has a header
section, followed by two blank lines, and then one or more
records. Each record is separated by a blank line, and consists of the following:

 - a version line ("WARC/1.0")
 - one or more key-value pairs (one per line)
 - another blank line, followed by page content (on one line)

You function will read crawl-data.warc (in this directory), so peek in
that file.  Your job is to write a generator function named
warc_records that takes a path to a WARC file, skips over its header,
and gives you a sequence of records as a dictionary. In addition to
the key-value metadata, add a key called 'Content' that has the
web page content.

Hint: Some idioms for processing lines of text in a file (the 'U' mode
means "universal newlines", so that \r\n, \n, etc. are all reported as
simply "\n"):

  # Stream through the lines
  with open(path, 'U') as file_handle:
      for line in file_handle:
          do_something_with(line)
  # Process lines more manually
  with open(path, 'U') as file_handle:
      while True:
          line = file_handle.readline()
          if line == "":
              break # No more lines
          do_something_with(line)
  # Process lines manually, generator style
  with open(path, 'U') as file_handle:
      while True:
          # Next line raises StopIteration if there are no
          # more lines to read.
          line = next(file_handle)
          do_something_with(line)
