Welcome to "Python - Beyond The Basics". I'm your instructor, Aaron Maxwell.
Reach me at aaron@powerfulpython.com.

This folder has course materials you will use in the class:

* PythonBeyondTheBasics.pdf - Extensive written material on the topics
  covered in the course, and more! Use to review and deepen your
  learning after class, or as a reference when doing the programming
  exercises (labs).

* slides - Slide decks used in the class.

* labs - In-class programming exercises. Your instructor will lead you
  through them.

* labs/py3 - The Python 3.x lab set.

* labs/py2 - The Python 2.7 lab set.

* solutions - Solutions to the labs. IMPORTANT: We've found that students learn
  and retain as much as TEN TIMES MORE when they only look at solutions as a
  last resort, peeking only for a hint to get un-stuck. Always do as much as
  you can on your own, so you'll learn a lot!

FURTHER READING

(Both books below are written primarily for Python 3, with commentary mixed in
on how Python 2 differs, as needed.)

* Powerful Python: The Most Impactful Patterns, Features, And Development
  Strategies Modern Python Provides, by Aaron Maxwell
  https://www.amazon.com/d/0692878971

  My own book. You already have some of it, in the courseware PDF.  If
  you sign up for the other courses I teach through O'Reilly, you'll
  get another chunk as part of its courseware.

* Powerful Python Blog
  https://powerfulpython.com/blog/

  In-depth articles on intermediate to advanced Python
  programming. For several, I wrote full custom applications to
  demonstrate some concept, pattern or set of features, and how they
  are used in real-world Python software.

* The Python Cookbook (3rd ed.), by Beazly and Jones
  http://www.amazon.com/dp/1449340377/

  Excellent book which, when used over time, will take you all the way from
  intermediate to advanced Python developer. Keep on your desk, right by your
  computer.
